First, Clone the repository. Then

```bash
yarn install

```

### Before doing a commit:

You have to add commits as you work on your issue using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary), replacing the `<your commit message>` text with your actual commit message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "<your commit message>"

   # An example:
   git commit -m "docs: corrected spelling of FEAUTRE"
   ```
